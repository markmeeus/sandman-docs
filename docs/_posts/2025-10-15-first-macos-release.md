# Sandman v0.1 - First macOS Release

Hey everyone! I'm excited to share that **Sandman v0.1 is now available for macOS!**

I just published the very first public release of Sandman on GitHub. This initial release brings executable API documentation to macOS, combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of Lua scripting.

## Download Now

You can download Sandman v0.1 for macOS (Apple Silicon) from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/markmeeus/sandman/releases/).

## What's Included

This first release includes:

- **Desktop App for macOS** - Native macOS application for Apple Silicon
- **HTTP Client & Server** - Make HTTP requests and spin up mock servers
- **Executable Notebooks** - Write and run Lua code blocks in Markdown files
- **Request Inspection** - View all HTTP requests and responses in real-time
- **Git-Friendly Format** - Your notebooks are plain Markdown files

## Getting Started

1. Download `Sandman-0.1-silicon.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/markmeeus/sandman/releases/)
2. Double-click the DMG and drag Sandman to your Applications folder
3. Open Sandman and start creating your first notebook
4. Check out the [documentation]({{ '/docs/' | relative_url }}) for guides and API reference

## Still a long road ahead

Sandman is currently far from finished. I have soo many ideas, but for now you can start using it for very basic scenarios. While it's already functional and useful for real work, you may encounter bugs or rough edges. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me improve it!

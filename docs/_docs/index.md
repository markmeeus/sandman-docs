## What is Sandman?

Sandman transforms markdown documents into interactive HTTP scripting environments. You can:

- **Write executable documentation** - Your API docs become working examples
- **Prototype servers quickly** - Spin up HTTP servers in seconds
- **Test APIs interactively** - Make requests and inspect responses in real-time
- **Share reproducible scripts** - Everything is contained in markdown files

## Core Features

### üìù Executable Markdown
Write markdown with embedded Lua code blocks that execute when you run them. Perfect for living documentation.

### üåê HTTP Client & Server
Built-in HTTP client for making requests and server capabilities for creating mock APIs and prototypes.

### üîç Request Inspection
Visualize HTTP requests and responses with detailed inspection tools and real-time logging.

### üõ†Ô∏è Rich API
Comprehensive Lua API with JSON handling, JWT support, Base64 encoding, and more utilities.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of what a Sandman document looks like:

```markdown
# My API Test

Let's create a simple server:

```lua
-- Start a server on port 8080
server = sandman.server.start(8080)

-- Add a route
sandman.server.get(server, "/hello", function(req)
    return {
        status = 200,
        body = sandman.json.encode({
            message = "Hello, World!",
            timestamp = os.time()
        }),
        headers = { ["content-type"] = "application/json" }
    }
end)
```

Now let's test our server:

```lua
-- Make a request to our server
response = sandman.http.get("http://localhost:8080/hello")
print("Status:", response.status)
print("Body:", response.body)
```
```
